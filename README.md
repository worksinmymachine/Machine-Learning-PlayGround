# ML Playground

Welcome to my ML Playground! This repository is a personal space where I experiment with various machine learning models and techniques using Python. Here, I explore different datasets, preprocess data, build models, and evaluate their performance. It's a learning journey, and I'm constantly updating it with new experiments and insights.

## Contents

- **Datasets**: Collection of datasets used for various experiments.
- **Preprocessing**: Scripts for data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **Models**: Implementation of different machine learning models.
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks with detailed analysis and experiments.
- **Utils**: Utility functions for common tasks.

## Tools and Libraries

This repository primarily uses the following tools and libraries:

- **Python**: The core programming language for all experiments.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## Getting Started

To get started with the code in this repository, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```sh
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
